# proid-hackathon-site

HTML code template for creating a webpage in google sites

The idea for this site is from one of my projects, where I had to design a hackathon website with the theme of National Healthcare Group Singapore in mind. This is not a government website but a personal project. Code is embedded into each page and uses a light mode theme, as well as blue and yellow colour scheme.

These are the pages in the code document, with a html file named extra.html for some of the navigation bar used in the creation of the site:

- index.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- events.html
- extra.html

Here is the google site if you are interested to check out
